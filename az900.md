# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900): Foundational Cloud Concepts

* https://learn.acloud.guru/course/83b086a9-7a1f-4798-9cc8-ce0ca2fda777/overview
* 2.5 hours

# describing cloud computing

## defining cloud computing

### misconceptions
* no singular cloud, many different providers, many services

### what is cloud computing
* cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale.
  * pay only for cloud services you use
  * lowering operating costs

### breaking down cloud computing

* delivery
  * delivery of computer services
    * servers, storage, DBs, etc
    * accessing over the internet ("the cloud")
    * the services are on demand
* advantages
  * do things better and faster
    * server in an instant
    * scale up and down
    * greater flexibility
* cost efficiency
  * pay only what youy need
    * lower operating costs
    * greater efficiency
    * scale as business needs change
* so... what is the cloud:
  * multiple vendors
  * on-demand delivery of compute services over the internet
  * do things better and faster
  * pay only for what you need

## shared responsibility model

### why shared responsibility matters

* clarification of roles and responsibility of cloud provider versus customer
  * efficiency and convenience
  * data privacy
  * flexibility in responsibility
  * defined roles for accountability

### division of responsibility

![](2024-07-23-22-10-10.png)

## understanding cloud models

### what are cloud models?
* each have trade offs

### private cloud
* privately hosted for a single customer / cloud for one
  * self-service model
  * completely private (no outside access)
  * better security and privacy
  * your own hardware means high upfront cost
  * more responsibility in charge of hardware
  * less flexibility compare to public cloud
* refer to shared responsbility... refer to on-prem

### public cloud
* hosted by third party provider
  * available to anyone
  * no upfront investment
  * much more flexibility
  * vendor responsible for hardware
  * shared tenancy with other users (with some exceptions)

### hybrid cloud
* combine private with public cloud
  * private connectivity (VPN, ExpressRoute, etc)
  * run workloads in most appropriate location
  * maintain control in private cloud/on-premises
  * skills needed to maintain both environments

#### variations of hybrid
* public/private
* multi-cloud
* Azure Arc: extend azure management to non-azure resources

## the economy of cloud computing

### expense strategies at a glance
* CapEx: investments in fixed assets
  * investements in long term assets
  * large upfront investments
* OpEx: ongoing expenses for business operations
  * low or no upfront investment
  * pay as you go

### capital expenditures technology costs
* servers, data centers
* requires forecasting long-term needs/values
* tax deduction for upfront costs

### operating expenditures technology costs
* generally accepted as cloud model
* no upfront investments
* pay only for what is needed
* ongoing monthly/annual costs
* no need to forecast long-term needs/value

### OpEx and cloud computing
* cloud model == consumption based
  * pay based on immediate usage
  * low usage == low costs
  * can increase resources if needed

## exam tips: describing cloud computing
* know what the cloud is
  * on demand devlivery of compute services over the internet
  * compute, networking,  storage,
  * flexibility is a key advantage
* shared responsibility
  * ongoing, foundational topic
  * separateion of responsibility between vloud vendor and customers
  * different cloud services have different responsibilities
* cloud models
  * private cloud: single customer, high upfront costs
  * public cloud: available to everyuone, greater flexibility (pay as you go)
  * hybrid cloud: connect public and private workloads, flexible, more complexity
* capex/opex
  * capex: large upfront costs and forecasting expenses over years
  * opex: cloud model, consumption model (pay as you go)... no large upfront costs

# cloud service types

* "as a service" branding
* core cloud service types
  * IaaS... cloud vendor manages:
    * physical data center
    * network/cabling
    * physical servers
  * PaaS... cloud vendor manages:
    * physical data center
    * network/cabling
    * physical servers
    * OS
    * Development tools/database management/business analytics
  * SaaS... cloud vendor manages:
    * physical data center
    * network/cabling
    * physical servers
    * OS
    * Development tools/database management/business analytics
    * Hosted applications
* responsibility and flexibility
  * each type of core cloud service types, depends on the level of control you need

## infrastructure as a service
### summary
* basic computing infra
* greater customization/control
* pay for what you allocate
* more mgmt overhead

### what is IaaS?
* managed IT infrastucture
* cloud vendor responsibility:
  * physical data center, network/cabling, physical servers
* pay-as-you-go managed it infrastructure
  * provisioned an dmanaged over the internet
  * fundamental building block of all other cloud services
  * primarily made up of VMs (networking and OS)

### what is a VM
* virtual version of a physical computer (infrastructure)
  * has CPU/RAM, disk, networking, OS, network controls (firewall)
* behind the scenes:
  * single physical server (hypervisor) hosting multiple VMs
    * Hyper-V and VMware
    * You manage a single VM that is only for you.
    * VMs are completely isolated from each other

### what can a VM do
* same capabilities as a physical computer
  * run any computer software
  * max control and flexibility
  * provision instantly

### customer responsibility
* more control == more responisbilitiy
  * software/OS updates
  * user management
  * network access (firewalls)
* want to manage less stuff?  consider PaaS or SaaS options.

## platform as a service
* prepackaged cloud services
* emphasis on app deployment
* pay for what you use
* less mgmt overhead

### what is PaaS?
* PaaS... cloud vendor manages:
  * same underlyind IaaS: physical data center, network/cabling, physical servers
  * Also: OS, Development tools/database management/business analytics
* Managed development and deployment services
  * develop apps/solutions without managing infra.
  * cloud vendor focuses on infra, you focus on deving solutions
    * ex: software dev tools, managed RDBMS, analytics
* PaaS terms: "fully managed"

### less management overhead
* cloud vendor manages:
  * operating systems (updates, etc)
  * server infrastructure (disk storage)
  * software licenses/middleware
  * DB management
  * auto-scaling
  * more...
* cloud manages different components for different services.

### examples of PaaS cloud services
* managed databases
* software development tools and deployment tools (pipelines)
* web app deployment
* storage services
* business analytics
* security solutions

### serverless
* extreme version of PaaS
* typical PaaS requires some resource management
* serverless, all resource management is not the responsibility of customer
  * just runs code
  * don't worry about where it runs
  * chared only when code is running
* azure functions == serverless

### trade offs of PaaS vs. IaaS
* trade off for less management
  * less control over infra
    * pre packaged configs that fit (most) use cases
  * limited choice of tools
    * pre-defined toolsets/use cases
  * app compatibility for PaaS

## software as a service
* ready-to-use apps
* focus is on end-user experience
* pay for what you subscribe
* minimal mgmt overhead

### what is Saas?
* SaaS... cloud vendor manages:
  * IaaS: physical data center, network/cabling, physical servers
  * PaaS: OS, Development tools/database management/business analytics
  * SaaS: Hosted applications
* cloud based/hosted application
* subscription base pricing
* examples: email, office tools, CRMs, etc.
  * m365, zoom, salesforce, slack

### what is customer repsonsibility
* accounts and identities
  * auth requirements
* device management (which device access)
  * ensure device security
* info and data
  * protecting data access
  * access control

### relationship of Saas and IaaS/PaaS
* SaaS apps are power by IaaS/PaaS services
  * M365 --> Azure
  * Google Drive --> GCP
  * Slack --> AWS

### SaaS benefits
* complete softare solution
  * ready-to-go software
    * easy scaling
    * pre-confed and easy to use
  * accessed over internet (no hosting required)
  * easy licensing
    * subscription model

## introducing defense in depth

### what is defense in depth
* objective: slow or stop unauthorized data access
* acheived by Layered defense
* if one layer is breached, other layers can still stop attacks

### castle example
* multiple layers to protect the king
  * maybe a moat
  * then high walls
  * the gaurds on the walls
  * then pouring hot oil
  * the additional fortifications inside of the castle space

### understanding defense in depth layers
* physical security
  * acts as first line of defense
  * building/hardware access
* identity and access
  * securign identities
  * grant account access to only what's needed
* perimeter
  * protect against network-based attackes
  * perimeter firewalls/DDoS protection
* network:
  * secure connectivity between resources
  * east-west 
  * securely connect to on-prem resources
* computer:
  * secure VMs
  * endpoint protection/OS patching
* application
  * resolving app vulns
  * secure secrets
  * design for security
* data
  * primary target of attackers
  * databases, disks, SaaS apps
  * control and limit access

## exam tips: cloud services types

### IaaS
* managed infra/VMs
* CPU/RAM/OS/networking
* full control, but with more responsibility
  * managing OS (updates)
  * user access

### PaaS
* fully managed cloud solution
* cloud vendor handles infra, you focus on deving solutions
  * don't need to manage infra
* specialized services for different use cases
* serverless = zero resource management
* trace less flexibility/control for less mgmt

### SaaS
* ready to go, cloud-based software
* productivity apps
  * accessed over the internet
  * hosting and scaling provided
* subscription model
* tailored for specilized use cases
* powered by IaaS/PaaS

### defense in depth
* defend data with layers of defense
* data/application/computer/network/permiter/identiy and access/physical security
* cloud vendor handles physical security

  * demand down == scale down (not overpaying)

### horizontal vs. vertical scaling
* horizontal: scaling out
  * add additional VMs
  * LB distro traffic
  * automatic, no downtime
  * typical cloud model
* vertical: scaling up
  * increase computer resources on an existing server/VM
    * add CPU/RAM/disk
    * usually manual, requires downtime/reboot

  * applies to the cloud vendoor's and your own resources
* deploy to multiple locations
  * global scale
  * protect against regional failure/disaster
  * bonus: always be close to your customer, whereever they are

### what is predictable performance
* consistent performance, all the time
  * regardless of demand/customer location
* always have enough resources when needed
  * autoscaling (horizontal scaling)
  * HA
  * load balancing
* plan your deployment around cloud-native best practices

# azure identity, authentication and authorization

## defining identity, authentication and authorization

### identity:
* who or what a person or object claims to be
* physical world:
  * passport, drivers license
* digital world:
  * Azure AD object

### authenticaiton: the process of validating an identity
* physical
  * house key
  * cert of auth
* digital
  * ssh key
  * ssl certs
  * email acct password

### authorization: the process of validating what an identity can do
* Physical
  * event ticket
  * gate specific key code
  * key card
* digital
  * application secret
  * shared access signature (SAS) token
  * key card

### Identity, authentication, authorization management

* azure: all the resoruces and services avialable in MSFT's cloud offering
* Azure AD/Entra ID: service for managing identity authen and author used to manage those things within Azure

## scope definitions
* identity: unique identifier for any digital object
* authenticaiton: proves identity
* authorization scopes identity
* all of these are needed in order to effectively admin any digital environment
* Azure AD/Entra ID: service provides all three
  

## azure AD (Azure AD)/Entra ID

### microsoft entra
* new product family
* includes all microsoft identity access capabilities including:
  * Azure AD, permissions management, Verified ID

### directory services
* Microsoft Entra
* Azure Active Directory Domain services
* Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID)

### azure AD vs. AD
* Azure Active Directory
  * modern office solution: designed for cloud-enabled services, services and platforms
  * modern web: azure AD was designed with Web 2.0 in mind and can integrate most complex web applicatiosn now and into the future.
  * modern authenticaiton: AAD auth supports modern authentication methods and will support them into the future
* AD
  * Legacy office solution: AD implemented several older techs to connect devices, like computers and printers
  * legacy web: AD was not designed within the era of Web 2.0 with its social media sites and the advent of compelx web apps in mind
  * legacy auth: AD auth uses services and protocols that are not available on Azure

* Azure Active Directory Domain Services
  * provides domain services

### Entra ID
* requirements
  * automatic/mandatory
    * every azure account automatically has Azure AD instance with it
  * minimum of one user
    * every AAD instance needs at least one user, and this user is created with the initial AAD instance
* optional:
  * custom domain name
  * Azure AD Connect (if on-premises AD present)

### Azure AD

#### what is a tenant?
  * organization: a tenant represents the organization
* dedicated AAD
  * a tenant is a dedicated instance of AAD that an organization receives when signing up for Azure
* separate
  * each tenant is distinct and completely separate from other AAD tenants.
* Maximum of 500 tenants
  * each user in Azure can be a mmember or guest of up to 500 AAD tenants

#### what is a subscription?
* billing entity
  * all resources within a subscription are billed together
* cost separation
  * you can have multiple subscriptions within a tenant to separate costs
* payment
  * if a subscription isn't paid, all the resources and services assocaited with the subscription stop.

## Create a group and Add a member in Entra ID
* this is a cloud guru lab

## Zero Trust Concepts

### classic trusted vs untrusted model

#### classic
* trusted perimeter
  * trusted boundary for secure access
  * restrict private access to secure networks
  * relies on lower level controls

### challenges with trusted perimeter model
* must be on corp network
  * remote work is challenging
    * VPN is extention of trusted perimeter
  * mobile device access even more challenging
  * risk: rogue user/maleware inside trusted permieter network can do evil

### enter zero trust
* what is zero trust?
  * all users assumed untrustworthy unless proven otherwise
  * trusted by identity
  * regardless of location (trusted or untrusted networks)
  * least priv access: just enough perms to perform job
  * simplified, centralized mgmt
* zero trust == trusted identities, not location

### zero trust in action
* access M365 email, docs, resources for remote workforce
  * access from anywhere
  * auth with identity, not over VPN
* centrally control access with Conditional Access policies
* Allow access only from approved managed devices
  * independent from network locaiton

### summary
* zero trust concepts:
  * classic is not well suited for modern envs
  * zero trusted pushes trust to the individual

## MFA

### MFA model
* have or auth user using multiple factors
  * something you know
  * something you have
  * something you are
* one or many requires

### MFA example
* web site requires second step in addition to username + password
  * somethng you know: password
  * something you have: cell phone
  * something you are: username

### MFA priciple
* MFA provides layed security for user identity
* requires at least two components
  * something you know
  * something you have
  * something you are
* MFA is becoming the norm

## Conditional Access

### conditional access concepts
* auth protectsion beyond username + password
  * logic is applied (if/then)
    * if user meets these conditions, then grant/block access to defined apps
  * often paid with MFA
    * centrally applied MFA

### how does conditional access work
* create conditional access policies
  * assign signals (conditions)
  * users/groups
  * app to grant/deny access
  * location (IP)
  * approved devices
* access decisions (grant/block access)
  * grant access
  * block access
  * require MFA

### conditional access scenarios
* enforce MFA for all admins or all users
* block signins using legacy auth protocols
* grant access to specific geo locations
* require organization managed devices for app signin

### summary
* conditional access
  * is a feature that provides additional layer of security to your envs and identity
  * rules are exercised logic (if/then) that permit or deny access depending on whether the rules are met.
* MFA is often implemented with Conditional ACcess as further security.
* Modern best practices encourage the user of Conditional Access.

## passwordless Authentication

### security vs. convenience

* MFA is more secure but less convenient
* more steps required to login
  * password + device/biometrics
  * increased user frustration:
    * if everything is not working as expected
    * overall, less convenient

### passwordless auth: one possible solution
* objective: increase convenience while staying secure
  * password only == convenient, but low security
  * passwords + MFA == less convenient, but high security
  * passwordless == convenient, and high security
* remove password, replace with something you have, are, know

### passwordless auth methods
* Microsoft authenticator app
    * MSFT MFA mobule app
    * configure in AAD
    * authenticate in app with biometrics/PIN
* Windows Hello
    * face recognition in Windows
* FIDO2 security key
    * hardware key

### example passwordless login scenario
* login to M365 and enter username
* instead of a password, you are prompted to check Microsoft Authenticator.
* user the biometric/PIN in the Authenticator app to confirm authentication
* confirm numerical challenge in Authentictor app.

### summary
* MFA is an important security feature with the drawback of reduced convenience.
* Passwordless auth increases convenience and security.
* MFA and passwordless auth can be implemented simultaneously to provide a conveneitn login with more robust security checks and conditional access

## External Guest Access

### challenge of external guest access
* scenario: interacting with third parties in streamlined Azure entra config
* solutions?
  * new IDs for every external user
    * requires external user to juggle two accounts
    * creates complexity with internal IAM
    * more IDs in your IAM lifecycle
  * current IDs for every external user
    * external user can utilize their existing accounts to access organizational resources
    * two problems (customers and consultantS) are best solved with two solutions

### solutions
* Azure AD B2B aka Entra External ID for Partners
  * Designed for interacting with internal resources
  * User has an identity inside of Entra ID that can be managed by your org.
* Azure AD B2C aka Entra External ID for Customers
  * designed for interacting with externally facing resources, like apps, web sites
  * user's identity is managed by whatever their provide is (MSFT, Google, Facebook, etc.)

### azure B2B (Entra exteral ID for partners)
* external user already has an ID with another service or provider
* your organization initiates an invitation to that external user's ID
* External user accepts the invitation, and a user object (ID) is created inside of your org based on that external ID.

### azure B2C
* external user already has an ID with another service provider
* external user is provided the option to use their existing ID.
* external user logs in using their current ID with their provided, and that auth is password into the application via a B2C directory (examples: via Oauth2, or OIDC).

### adding a guest user
* invite a variety of account types (IdP)
  * msft, google, facebook, and others
* assign permissions for guest account
* principle of least priv
* different perms between Entra ID and Azure subscription
* Optional: assign guest user to apps
* Optional: apply cross-tenant Conditional Access policy (reqire MFA or approved managed devices)

### inviting an external consultant
* scenario: invite an external consutlant to collaborate inside of your Azure tenant
* Configure identity provider (if not MSFT)
* invite external party
* after guest user accepts invitation, assign permissions
  * optionally: assign apps, apply conditional access policy

### summary
* external guest access enables ecurity outside of your org boundaries
* provides visibility of external guest activity within your org IT borders
* B2B access provides a federated level of trust for tenants
* B2C access allows for improved intergration with customer systems

## Azure AD domain services

### limitations of Entra ID and cloud migrations
* legacy apps which are unable to use modern authn protocols (oauth 2.0)
* require traditional AD DS management and protocols
  * group policy, LDAP, NTLM, Kerberos

### possible solutions
* continue using on-prem AD and sync to Entra ID with Azure AD Connect
* config AD server on Azure VM
  * also known as "self-managed AD DS"
  * You maintain/config the OS
* Azure Active directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS)
  * Managed AD DS
  * Provides classic AD features in a managed service
    * group policy, LDAP, NTLM, Kerberos

### how Azure AD DS works

![](2024-07-29-13-52-36.png)

* Azure AD DS is a manage
* No need for OS config/mgmt
  * service is backed by two Windows DCs in HA
* Creates a unique name space
  * standalone domain, not an extension of on prem AD domain
* one-way esync from Entra ID to Azure AD DS

### Azure AD DS Scenario
* requirement to lift and shift legacy enterprise app to Azure VM
  * app does not support modern auth protocols
* GOAL: requirement to integrate app with classic, cloud-hosted AD using managed services
* Solution: cloud hosted legazy app auths with Azure AD DS

### summary
* Azure AD DS
  * provides legazy AD features inside Azure.
  * Is a managed service inside of Azure with no infra maintenance required and high availability features.
  * Integrates via one-way sync to Entra ID
  * Helpful when migrating or integrating legazy apps that do not support modern protocols.

## Managing access to resources with RBAC

### Azure RBAC
* Control access to resources and services based on role assigne to user, device, app or service.

### Azure RBAC roles
* built-in roles: based on broad, general use cases
  * variations of: owner, contributor, reader
* custom roles: fine-grained, specific user cases
  * components:
    * role definitions
    * permissions
    * scope
    * inheritance

### Azure RBAC role assignment
* scope scope scope!
* Scope: only the permissions necessary
* Scope: only the resources/services necessary
* Scope: only to individuals when absolutely necessary

### inheritance
* capability of custom or built-in roles to inherit permissions from other roles
* or application of permissions to a lower-level organization construct
  * Capabilities should not be assigned specifically to entities, create a group and then assign the permissions to the group

### RBAC best practices
* least privs: the least amount of permissions as necessary when granting access.
* use of roles: use built-in roles whenever possible, use custom roles with care.
* role segregation: separate duties and responsibilities, avoid combining roles that grant conflicting perms and excessive access.
* resource or service scope: avoid permission sprawl.
* review, audit, and document: check and double check, and document permission structures.

### summary of RBAC
* both built-in roles and custom roles
* set role assign scope
* inheritance
  * using groups to assign roles is more efficient


## Revisiting defense in depth

![](2024-07-29-14-08-29.png)

### overview
* objective: protect data and prevent if from being stolen by folks who aren't prived
* method: layered defence

### castle example again

![](2024-07-29-14-09-00.png)


### identity example

![](2024-07-29-14-09-43.png)
* multiple layers to protect usage of an identity
  * password required
  * MFA 
  * Conditional access policies

### understand defense in depth layers and relate to identity
* defense in depth for identities focuses on a few specific responsibilities in the shared responsibility model:
  * Accounst and identities
  * identity and directory infra
  * apps
  * network controls (conditional access policies)

### summary
* even at the identity level, layed defense is the best practice
* understand how the various layers of identity work and how they work together
* defense in depth at the identity level can even play into app sec

## exam tips
* all are needed to effectively admin env (via Entra ID)
  * identity: unique identitier for any user, computer, app, service, etc
  * authentication: provides identity
  * authorization: scopes identity
* entra ID
  * AD is not the same as Entra ID!
  * every Azure account has an Entra ID service
  * a tenant is dedicated instance of Entra ID (representing the organization in Azure)
  * a user can be a member or guest of up to 500 tenants
  * A subscription is a billing entity, all resource can only belong to a signle subscription.
  * entra ID is the identity, auth/auth service built into azure to admin access to resources
* Zero trust
  * all users are assumed untrustworthy unless proven otherwise
    * trusted by identity 
    * regardless of location (trusted/untrusted networks)
    * least priv access
    * simplified, centralized management
  * zero trust== no presumed trust, but identities can be validated.
* MFA:
  * provides layered security for user identity
  * requires at least two components:
    * something you know
    * something you have 
    * something you are
  * MFA is recommended by MSFT for all MSFT identities
* conditional access:
  * provides logic to validate identities
  * MFA is implemented via conditional access
    * recommended by MSFT
* passwordless auth
  * increase convenience while staying secure
    * remove password
    * and provides:
      * something you know
      * something you have 
      * something you are
* external guest access
  * enables security outside of your organizational boundaries
  * provides visibility of external guest activity within your organalization boundaries
  * B2B access provides a federated level of trust for tenants
  * B2C access allows for improve inte4gration with customer systems (via oauth, etc)
* Azure AD DS
  * legacy AD features within auzre
  * is a managed service
  * integrates with Entra ID
  * Helpful when migrating or integrating legazy apps that don't support modern protocols
* RBAC
  * controls access to resources based on role assigned to user, device, app or service)
    * least priv
    * role segregation
    * Review, audit and document
* defense in depth
  * layered defense around user identity
  * how to the layers of identity work together
  * defense in depth can play into app sec
* "Management groups are an Azure resource management scope that sit above individual subscriptions. They are in fact a grouping, or collection, of multiple subscriptions. Permissions, policies, and compliance settings applied to a management group are automatically inherited by all subscriptions inside that group."

## Azure ARM Templates

## description
* files written in JSON that define the infrastructure and config of resources in Azure
  * important for provisioning resources

## benefits
* declarative: tell azure what needs to be deploy, not how it should be done.
* repeatable: a template deploys the same thing every time.
* modular: break large deployments down into smaller components
* testable: test your ARM deployment before pushing to Azure
* exportable: take an existing deployment and export the template

## template examples

* JSON:
  
![](2024-07-30-14-06-10.png)

* BICEP:

![](2024-07-30-14-06-45.png)

## deployment example
* if you deploy the following example:
  * stoarge account:
    * name: pssa01
    * region: centralus
    * availability: LRS (locally redundant)
* if you try to deploy again, it compares the template to running state and does nothing.
  * if a change occurs, then just the change is affected.

### summary
* azure ARM templates are definitions for resources in azure
* JSON or BICEP
* Azure ARM Templates are: declarative, repeatable, modular, testable, and exportable.
* able to not have to redeploy, but affect state

## exam tips

### interacting with Azure using ARM
* Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the service for deploying and managing resources in Azure.
* Azure Resource Manager (ArM) provides consistency, convenience, control, confidence and capability for Azure resource deployment.
* Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the bridge between user and Azure resources.

### Understanding Azure portal
* visual interface for:
  * deploying
  * configuring and auditing resources/services in Azure
* PRovides web based access to CLI tools
* First place to go when learning deployment and configuration
* Primary place to try out new Azure tech
* Visual data represented for:
  * monitoring
  * cost/billing
  * organization

### Azure CLI
* compiled, installable availabe in Azure Cloud Shell and on a workstation.
* Uses unix-style command langauge
* Platform agnostic.

### azure powershell
* consistent syntax (verb-noun)
* Versatile: can be used anywhere pwsh is installed.
* documentation is available via the `get-help` function

### Accessing Azure Cloud Shell
* automatic auth
* choice of shell (bash or powershell)
* azure powershell and azure CLI built in
* Direct access to Azure Storage

### Azure ARM templates
* key tool when provisioning resources in Azure and they allow us to define the infrastructure and config of those resources.
* Written in JSON (or BICEP).
* Are:
  * declarative: tell azure what needs to be deploy, not how it should be done.
  * repeatable: a template deploys the same thing every time.
  * modular: break large deployments down into smaller components
  * testable: test your ARM deployment before pushing to Azure
  * exportable: take an existing deployment and export the template
* allow for many config changes to be implemented without redeploying.

## exam
* how many free trials per account: Microsoft accounts can have only a single free trial subscription to Azure.

## summary of course
* Identity
  * Entra ID is the fundamental service that manages all identity in Azure
* Deployment
  * deployment of resources can be done through a GUI, CLI, or prgrammatically.
* Management
  * Azure provides hierarchy, role and customization to allow for granular management of resources.
* additional courses:
  * AZ-900 Azure Architecture and Services

  * Azure Security and Governance


# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900): Azure Security Management and Governance

* https://learn.acloud.guru/course/31eb93c3-1f48-4906-b657-211eb44fba34/overview
* 6.4 hours
* YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE THE COURSE "Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900): Azure Architecture and Services" before taking this.

# describing cost management in azure

## defining cost management
* set a financial tools available to anyone with access to a billing account, subscription, resource group or management group
* theprocesses involved in planning evaling and controlling the budget of a project or business
* In azure, it involves understanding and controlling where and how resources are being used and billed.

### why does it matter
* unmonitred cloud expenses can lead to sginioficant unplanned costs
* cost mgmt ensures
  * predictable monthly bills
  * efficient use of resources
  * reduction of waste
  * improved financial forecasting

### intro to cost management tools
* Azure CMB: azure cost management and billing allows viewing, analyzing and optimizing costs
* azure advisor: provides personalized best practices to reduce costs.
* azure budgets: set budgets and creates alerts to monitor spending.

## subscriptions in cost management
* what are subscriptions: an agreement with MSFT enabling access to its cloud services.
* the highest logical billing object.
  * a boundary that delineates resource usage, access and billing.
* how subscriptions relate to cost managmeent
  * every azure service consumed is billed to its associated subscription.
  * ant the end of the billing cycle (variable), the bill is due.
* Azure hierarchy review
  * management group: many subscriptions inside of it
    * ie: "engineering"
  * subscriptions
    * ie: "software engineering", "mechanical engineering", "electrical engineering"
  * resource groups
  * resources
* subscription offerings
  * pay as you go: pay for what is used without upfront costs
  * enterprise agreement: commit to a certain level fo usage in exchange for discounted rate.
  * azure dev/test: discounted rates for dev and test envs.
  * free account: incldues a limited number of free services for a limited time and continuously free up to a usage threshold.
* subscription pricing models
  * reserved instances: discounts offered by committing to certain services for one or three years.
  * spot pricing: use spare capacity at a discounted rate but can be preempted by azure at any time
  * hybrid use benefits: on-prem windows service licenses can offer savings when migrating to azure
* bringing it all together
  * subscriptions and their various components are intricately tired to cost management
  * by understanding the different oferrs and their cost structures, orgs can make informed decisions,e ffectively manage their cloud expenses and optimize their cloud investments.

## factors that influence cost
* resources types
  * VM: billed base on compure, memory, storage OS and time
  * storage accounts: bileld based on type (blobk, file, fdisk, etc) and redundancy
  * data transfers: inbound data is usually free, outbound often costs.
  * databases: billed based on traxnactiosn and/or dedicated resources
* location/region:
  * azure is a global offering, and the decision to place resources within location/region is generally influenced by the following:
    * local regulations
    * energy costs
    * demand within region or data center
  * consider deployign to lower cost regions but always consider latency and data residency.
* service tiers: balance between cost and functionality decided by requirements.
  * VMs
    * basic vs standard
    * optmization (graphics, memory)
    * stanard HDD, standard SSD, premium SSD
  * storage accounts:
    * blog (standard, premium)
    * files (premium, ghot, cold)
    * data lake (standard, premium)
    * HDD vs SSD (standard, premium, ultra)
  * databases:
    * single vs. elastic pool
    * vCore vs DTU
    * GP, BC, Hyper
    * Provisioned vs. serverless
* reserved instances: committment == savings; predictable/steady state workloads are good candidates.
  * certain az services for a duration (1 or 3 years) in exchange for discounted rates.
  * significant savings compared to pay-as-you-go.
  * requires an upfront commitment, so assess your long-term needs carefully.
* azure hybrid benefits: hardness on-prem benefits
  * azure Hybrid Benefits: allows leveraging existing on-prem licesenes (ie: windows server, desktop, etc).
  * different support tiers come at different costs.
  * add-ons, extensions, or third-party services may have separate costs.
* summary
  * cloud resource cost involes many factors
  * know the context of cost-saving measures
  * commit where it makes sense
  * leverag ethe tools available to forecast.

## azure pricing calulator
* what is the azure pricing calculator
![](2024-07-31-05-18-38.png)
  * purpose: forecasting your cloud expenditures
* building your azure financial plan
  * consider the type and scale of your deployment requirements and input them into calc
  * experiment with flexible requirements (tiers, instances types, etc)
  * be aware of yoru hard requirements (regarding: regions, data transfer needs, etc)
* deciphering the calc's output
  * cost breakdown:
    * cost categories: detailed breakdown of costs, categorized by services used
    * visualization: charts and graphs to make analysis easier
    * time period: to view by daily, yearly, etc
  * monthly cost estimate
    * fixed vs. variable: undersatnd which costs of fixed or if they're variable
    * peak costs: potential peak costs... ie: if your workload has seasonal changes or high use periods
    * reservations/discount: analyzes the reservation/discounts that can benefit you.
  * other costs
    * data transfer: some level of outbound transfer may be included in base pricing, excessive may incur additional costs.
    * bundled pricing: some services might offer bundled pricing (a set of resources have cost benefits)
    * licensing: some services may have licenses, some may not
    * support: premium support offerings
    * add-ons: some services have additional features/services (ie: additional analytics)
* refining your financial forecast
  * export results in formats to integrate data into additional tools
  * adjust various parameters to discover cost-savings (Scaling, regions, instances, hybrid benefit, etc)
  * use the estaimte in larger cost mgmt strategy
  * set budget, monitor costs, and continually optimize
    * Azure Advisor will analyze usage
* common mistakes when using Azure Pricing Calc
  * overestimating resource needs: scale up from small
  * forgetting data transfer costs: inbound are typically free, outbound tranfers cost
  * ignoring price variations by region: make sure you track your deployment region!
  * not factoring in or assuming discount: take advantage of discounts
* tips for more accurate estimates
  * regularly update usage patterns
  * factor in growth
  * use azure's pricing examples (ie: for web apps, iot, etc)
  * stay up to date with pricing changes.

### azure pricing calculator demo
* as directed

![](2024-07-31-05-18-38.png)

* click on VMs
* scroll down, and review "Your Estimate"
  * at various times MSFT will have offers to scale VMs into new data centers in various regions, etc.

    ![](2024-07-31-05-35-33.png)

  * review the region, as it will default to a region which may not be cost beneficial.
  * If you are using Windows as your OS, make sure to review the Azure Hybrid Benefit as it can greatly decrease pricing
* click on storage accounts
  * scroll down and review "your estimates"
  * adjust, etc.
* remember to review "estimate upfront costs" at the bottom

### summary
* Azure Pricing Calculator is great for estimating what your cloud costs count look like
* an excellent way to explore the question, "what if I deployed a..." and identifies dependency costs
* BUT should not be taken as a quote for costs!

## azure TCO calculator

  * the `Management Group` level is for broad level application
    * by default applies to... 
      * all `subscriptions` within the `Management Group`
      * all `resources groups` within all in-scope `subscriptions`
      * all `resources` within all in-scope `resource groups`
  * at the `subscription` level is often for department, customer or project level applications
* hierarchy principles
  * azure hierarchy structure provides granular governance managemenet
  * resources inherit what is applied at higher levels
  * target regulartory compliance that refers to environments

## azure policy
* Azure Policy is an azure service that enables the creation, assignment and mgmt of policies to enforce rules and effectes over Azure resources and services.

### anatomy of a policy
* conditions
    * `parameters` that define what the policy is performing
    * `assignment` that defines where the policy is performing.
* effects
    * `audit`: check to see if something is true or false
    * `enforce`: you've checked, and you are setting state (preventative control)
* policy json structure
![](2024-07-31-09-54-04.png)

* read only: allows vieweing of a resource but not modification
  * use where changes could be distruptive (like a prod DB)
* delete: prevents the resource from being deleted but allows modification
  * use where resources should not be deleted, but may need to be changed (like a vnet)
* no lock

### resource lock scopes
* locks are inherited by scope
* `subscription` level
* `resource group` level
* `resource` level

### applying Resource Locks
* azure portal
* azcli
* azpwsh

## resource locks in practice
* scenarios:
  * protecting prod envs

# Architectural Components of Azure

## Azure Regions

### understanding regions

![](2024-08-01-09-20-59.png)

* where is Azure? how is it physically organized?
* "a region is a set of datacenterse deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connection through a dedicated regional low-latency network." - MSFT
  * geographically distributed groups of datacenters
  * region = one or more data centers that are close by and connected with low latency
  * multiple regions strategically located worldwide
* 60+ regions
* Private global fiber network
  ![](2024-08-01-09-21-31.png)

### understandign regions: example west US 3
* multiple dat centers
* each datacenter is independent from each other (power, cooling, networking)
![](2024-08-01-09-22-17.png)

### how to choose a region
* you can select a region for deploying azure resources
* location: choose a region closest to your users to minimize latency
* features: some features aren't in all regions.  If you need a specific feature, some regions might be unavailable.
* price: the price of services varies from region to region.
* you will often have to choose which is the most important: location, features, or price

### Region Pairs

![](2024-08-01-09-24-14.png)

* two closely linked regions for redundancy
  * each region is paried: all (except Brazil South) are paired within the same geographic area, at least 300 miles apart.
  * outage failover: if the primary region has an outage, you can failover to the secondary region
  * planned updates: only one region is a pair is updated at any one time.
  * replication: some services use paired regions for repl.

### sovereign regions
* isolated regions ensuring government compliance within specific jurisdictions
  * not part of azure public cloud and fibre backgbone
  * approval required to join
  * not all services available.
  * two examples:
    * Azure for US government
    * Azure China

#### sovereign regions: Azure for US Government

![](2024-08-01-09-27-27.png)

* meets higher compliance requirements: a cloud for mission across data classifications
* eligibility: US goverment entity or solutions provider:
  * federal, state, local, or tribal governments
  * government contractors

#### sovereign regions: Azure China
* isolated regions required for Azure workloads in Chine
  * operated by third party provider (21vianet)
  * data stays in China's datacenter to ensure compliance
  * requires business presence in China

## summery
* regions:
  * geographically distributed physical infra
  * multiple nearby datacenters in each region
* region pairs:
  * linked regions in same geographic area
  * redundancy/repl
* sovereign regions
  * isolated/private regions in US/China
  * requirements to join
  * meet compliance requirements

## azure Availability Zones

### what are availability Zones
* physically separate datacenters within an azure region
  * physical location: each AZ is a physical location within a reagion, which caontains at least one DC per zone
  * independant: each zone has its own power, cooling and networking for HA.
  * an Availability Zone: has a minimum of three zones, not avialable in all regions.

### visual representation

![](2024-08-01-09-32-57.png)

* maintain 2ms latency round trip between zones

### regional availability

![](2024-08-01-09-33-53.png)

* not all regions have availability Zones
* at least one zone-enabled region per country with Azure presence
  * Azure recommends that the nearest region with zones available if there are in local AZ available.

### using AZs

![](2024-08-01-09-36-18.png)

* goal: redundancy **within** a region
  * solution/service repled across multiple zones
* if one zone goes down, service is still operational
* essential for adding redundancy to your app

#### methods of using AZs
* zonal services: you associate a resource with a specific AZ/zones
* Zone-redundant services: service automatically repls across zones (ie: zone redundant storage (ZRS))
* duplicating services and/or data across zones has additional costs.

### summary
* availability Zones: isolated, independent datacenters in a single Azure region
* focus on redundancy: if one zone is unavailable, others still available, design apps/service to take advantage of multiple zones.

## resource organization
* management infrastructure
* how do we manage and organize all azure resources?

### four hierarchical layers of resource organization
* `Management Groups`
  * `Subscriptions`
    * `Resource Groups`
      * `Resources`

### resources:
* basic building block
* anything you create is a `resource`
* assigned to a `region` (usually, some are global)
* every `resource` has a name (some need to have a global unique name)
* most `resources` have a cost (except networks)

### resource groups:
* groupings of `resources`
* all `resources` must be in a `resource group`
* MSFT recommendation is to group `resources` with the same lifecycle/access control needs
* flexible/no hard rules but... you may want to group by: access control or lifecycle needs.

#### resource group constraints
* one `resource`: each `resource` can only exist in a sinhle `resource group`
* add/remove: you can add or remove `resources` to any `resource group` at any time
* move `resources` easily: you can move a `resource` from one `resource group` to another
* can span multiple regions: `resources` from multiple regions can be in one `resource group`
* is not an access control boundary: you can give users access to a `resource group` and everything in it.
* interact: `resources` can interact with other `resources` in different `resource groups`
* location bound: a `resource group` is bound to a region as it stores metadata about the `resources` in it

### subscriptions
* management: all `resource groups` (hence `resources`) belong in a `subscription`
* access control: user accounts/perms granted to `subscriptions`
* billing boundary: payment method associated with `subscriptions`
* a single Azure Account can have multiple `subscriptions`

#### when would you want to use separate subscriptions

![](2024-08-01-09-56-46.png)

* separate billing centers: per department for example
* separate access control boundaries: separate access to resources

### management groups
* centralized management for multiple `subscriptions`, hence ideal for larger organizations with multiple subscriptions
* can contain `management groups` and `subscriptions` itself!
* does not have `resources` assigned directly
* this is an optional object group used to easily management multiple `subscriptions`
  * policies applied to a `management group` are applied to all child objects

### summary
* management group (optional): contains other management groups or subscriptions (is used to manage subscription management)
* subscriptions: high level billing and access control boundary
* resource group: groups of resources with same lifecycle/access control needs
* resources: everything you create in azure

## resource hierachy
* policies and permissions are applied downward
* organization and hiearchy is parent-child relationship
* goal: unified policy access management

### similarities to file system

![](2024-08-01-10-04-47.png)

* child objects have one parent only
* child objects automatically inherit policies/access from parent

### summary
* policies and permissiosn are applied from parent to child objects
* each child object can have exactly one parent object
* each parent can have multiple child objects

## exam tips
* Azure regions: globally distributed groups of datacenters
  * each region is several nearby datacenters
    * resources are assigned to a region
    * location/features/price key factors to consider when creating resources
  * region pairs:
    * each region paried with another one in country (except brazil)
    * redudancy/failover location
  * Sovereign regions:
    * isolated regions for govt compliance
    * azure for us govt
      * govt agency or contractors only
    * azure china
      * must have to do business in China
      * managed by a third party
* Availability Zones
  * fault isolation intra-region
    * independant DCs within a region
    * plan to add redundancy to your app/soluition
    * if one fails, antoehr in the regions till works
  * Using AZs
    * zonal: ping resource to specific zone
    * zone redundant: service automatically repls across multiple zones
* resource organization
  * `Management Groups`: centrally manage multiple subscriptions, is an optional component
    * `Subscriptions`: contains multiple resource groups, can act as an access control boundary, act as billing boundary
      * `Resource Groups`: hold resources with same access/lifecycle needs
        * `Resources`: every object created in Azure
* resource hierarchy: top down application of access/policies

## quiz
* What can be managed through the lifecycle management of Azure resource groups? Individual resources within the group
* Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of Azure availability zones? Data residency

# Azure Compute

## Azure Compute Concepts

### defining Compute
* azure compute is an on-demand computing service that provides computing resource such as disk, processors, RAM, networking and OSes.

### azure compute options
* differente options for different options
* IaaS
  * VMs
* PaaS
  * Azure App Service
  * Azure Functaions
  * Azure Container Instances
  * Azure Kubernetes Services

### revisiting IaaS vs. PaaS

![](2024-08-01-15-45-53.png)

* trade-offs of flexibility vs. mgmt overhead
  * IaaS has more flexibility but requires more mgmt
  * PaaS has less flexibility but requires less mgmt.

## Virtual Machines (VMs)

### what is a VM
* customizable, scalable and on demand server
* IaaS
* Virtualized server
  * hosted on underlying hypervisor
  * you have full control over VM
  * run almost any app
* windows or linux OSes are offered

### VM components
* CPU/RAM
* Disk
* Networking
* OS
* Network access controls (firewall)

### VMs and Networking
* VMs must be deployed to a network
  * On azure, these networks are called Virtual Network (VNet)
  * VNets includes on or more subnets
* VM assigned privde and public IP address
  * must have private IP addr assigned, public optional
  * Attacked to NIC

### configuring VMs
* choose CPU, RAM and Disk
* VM size = preconfiged CPU/RAM combos (these are given as options when creating a new VM)
  * optionally, CPU and Disk types
* VM sizes group into "series" (A series, B series, D series...)
  * difference series for different use cases
* Configure Disk
  * various sizes and speeds

### description of VM sizes

![](2024-08-01-15-51-14.png)

### VM pricing
* different pricing for different components
* CPU/RAM (compute)
  * priced by the minute
  * more compute == higher costs
  * deallocated (stopped) VMs not charged for compute
* Disk
  * changed whether VM is running or not
* licensed OSes
  * Windows, RHEL, etc
  * pay-as-you-go license charged same as Compute
* public IP addr
  * chaged by the hour
  * Pricing model depends on SKU
    * dynamic public IP addr SKU: no change when VM deallocated
    * static public IP addr SKU: charged regardless of VM state

### use cases for VMs
* pros
  * control: use VMs when you need to control all aspects of an env or machine.
  * app compatbility: install specific apps on Windows or Linux Machines.  Better legacy support
  * migrating existing infra: you can move existing resources and VMs to Azure from on-prem or another cloud
  * Testing and dev: quickly and easily test apps and configs, when done destroy.
  * Extend your data center: extend on prem servers to work with Azure VMs to support a hybrid cloud, which is useful for DR.
* cons
  * more stuff to manage: more mgmt overhead, OS updates, patches, user control, software envs, database configs, etc
  * higher costs: specialized services for bloud-native apps often cost less
  * complexity in scaling: scaling is often a more manual process.  Scale sets help, but still not as automated as PaaS services

### summary
* what is a VM
  * on demand server
  * IaaS
* pricing
  * compute/licensed OS: only when running
  * disk: always charged regardless of state of VM
  * IP addr: dynamic are not charged when released, static are charged
* use cases:
  * full control
  * run any software
  * extend data center
  * much more to manage

## VM scale sets
* what are VM Scale Sets
  * auto scaling groups of identical VMs
  * create and manage multiple, load-balanced, identical VMs

### use cases for VM scale sets
* too much load/traffic for server to handle
* manually creating new VMs is time-intensive process, want to automatically create copies **when needed**.

### how VM Scale Sets work
* multiple identical VMs
  * identically configed
  * all managed from the same place
* behind a load balancer
  * directs traffic to available VMs
  * single frontend for users (ie: a single website address)
* increase/decrease VM count
  * can automatically or manually adjust count
  * horizontal scaling

### benefits of Scale Sets
* multiple VMs: simple to manage multiple identical VMs using an LB
* high availability: if one VM fails or stops, the others in scale set wil keep working.  VMs can be deployed across multiple zones in a single region (they are zone redundant).
* auto scaling: automatically match demand by adding or remoiving VMs from the scale set
* large scal: run up to 1000 VMs in a single scale set
* no extra cost: no added cost for using scale sets (VMs all cost money).

### creating clone VMs
* from a baseline image:
  * capture image from baseline/reference VM image
  * Scale Set VMs created from captured image
* configuration script at startup
  * new clone VM runs config script on first boot
* combo of both
  * reference image + additional configs

### summary
* scale sets = identical VMs
  * create and remove as needed
  * centrally managed
* purpose
  * handle increased/decreased load as usage grows/shriks
  * automatically or manually adjust counts
  * paired with load balancer
* creating clones
  * baseline image
  * config script

## availability sets
* purpose of availability sets
  * high availability for static VMs in single datacenter or Zone
### differences compared to scale sets
* Availability Sets are:
  * non-identical VMs
  * no auto-scaling
  * single datacenter/zone

### breaking down availability sets
* logical grouping of VMs with separate fault and update domains for HA

### Fault Domain
* single fault domain: hypervisor host instances with common power source and network switch
  * azure will automatically place the VMs onto the hypervisor based on availability, therefore it's possible to have two VMs on the same fault domain.

### Update Domain
* single Update Domain: groups of hypervisors that can be rebooted at the same time.
  * supports for MSFT to admin their hypervisors
  * not dependant on physical rack/location
  * two VMs in same update domain may both be temporarily unavailable at the same time

### spreading VMs across update and fault domains
* adding static VMs to an avaialbility set ensures VMs are place:
  * on hypervisors with separate maintenance windows
  * on hypervisors on different server racks
* result: high availability in case of power supply failure, network switch failure and/or rolling hypervisor updates

### visual example of Availability Sets

![](2024-08-01-22-02-54.png)

* max limits for Availability Sets:
  * 20 update domains
  * 3 fault domains

### when would you use an Availability Sets?
* High Availability for multiple unique VMs that don't need auto-scaling
* example: ecommerse site with multiple servers
  * payment processing, inventory management, user auth, data analytics
  * VMs can't easily be cloned
  * no auto-scaling needed

### summary
* what are availability sets:
  * high availability within a single zone/data center
  * non-identical VMs
* fault domains: server rack with shared power/networking
* Update domains: hypervisor groups on same maintenance schedule
